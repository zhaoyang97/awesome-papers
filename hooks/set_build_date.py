"""Inject today's ISO date into ``config.extra.build_date`` at build time.

Used by ``overrides/main.html`` as a fallback for JSON-LD
``datePublished`` / ``dateModified`` when a page does not declare its own
``date:`` frontmatter. Generating dynamically avoids checking a hardcoded
date into git (which would otherwise make every page look "updated on a
fixed date" forever).
